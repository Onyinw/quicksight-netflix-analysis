## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Amazon QuickSight** – AWS’s business intelligence tool for data visualization
- **Amazon S3** – Used to host the dataset and the `manifest.json` file
- **CSV and JSON** – Netflix dataset (`netflix_titles.csv`) and manifest descriptor

---

## 📄 Project Overview

In this project, I:

- Uploaded Netflix data to an **S3 bucket**
- Created a **manifest.json** file to structure the dataset for QuickSight
- Connected the dataset to QuickSight
- Created different types of visualizations:
  - Donut charts
  - Bar graphs
  - Line charts
- Applied **filters** to segment the data by genre, release year, and content type
- Set up a final **dashboard** and exported the visualizations as a **PDF**

## 🖼️ Key Visuals

- Distribution of Netflix content over the years
- Top genres like Action, Thriller, and Comedy
- Breakdown of TV Shows vs Movies
- Filtered views using category and release year

## 📁 File Included

- [`Visualize data with QuickSight.pdf`](./Visualize%20datawith%20QuickSight.pdf) – Final project summary with visualizations and reflections

## 🤔 What I Learned

- How to structure datasets for QuickSight using a manifest file
- Importance of bucket permissions and linking S3 to QuickSight
- Hands-on use of charts and filters in a BI tool
- How to publish and export QuickSight dashboards as reports

## 🚀 Next Steps

I plan to explore:
- AWS Cloud Security (Day 3 of the NextWork Challenge)
- Integrating QuickSight with live databases
- Automating data refresh in QuickSight
